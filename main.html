    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that helps us analyze the efficiency of an algorithm. It measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of input size. An efficient algorithm performs well even as input size grows.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to run as a function of input size. It is often expressed using Big-O notation, such as O(n), which describes how memory usage grows with input size.</p>
