	<h1> Time Space Complexity </h1>
	<p> Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that helps us analyze the efficiency of an algorithm. It measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of input size. An efficient algorithm performs well even as input size grows.  </p>
